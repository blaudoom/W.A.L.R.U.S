# W.A.L.R.U.S
## Web Assessment Logging and Reporting ...Uh ... SYSTEM!

### What is it?
W.A.L.R.U.S is an UI for nmap. The idea is to gather cumulative information from several Nmap scans in one location. 
Many times when scanning larger networks or just wonky servers, some services appear online on some scans and not on others.
I wanted to gather this cumulative information in one view, where I can see what services have been online on different scans.


### How does it work?

### How do I use it?

### How do I install it?

### How do I configure it?

### Future Plans or stuff I was too lazy to do properly

- Reporting with a template
- Adding other scanning tools like nikto, dirb, gobuster, etc.
- Proper clean UI repo. This one is scraped from Vuestic Admin Template
- Proper input sanitation, if someone wants to run this to be executable remotely. Now it has straight through command execution.
- Proper logging, now it's just a print to console
- Proper error handling, now it's just a print to console
- Proper documentation, now it's just a README.md
- Proper testing, now it's just a print to console
- More Nmap options, now it's just a few. You can always use the custom command option, but all output is not parsed.
